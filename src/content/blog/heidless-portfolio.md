## site

I took building this site an an opportunity to re-explore javaScript and experience React | NextJS.

Additionally, the Agilista in me needed to first establish a clear path from inception to Live.

This led to an in depth exploration of gCloud, Containerisation, Docker, docker compose and Deployment in General.

### the App itself

The portfolio is structured as a React App frontend supported by a dJango backend.

### enhancements

- React Frontend end hosted on Cloud Run (with auto-build via Git Trigger)
- dJango Backed hosted on Google App Engine
- [ADD PGDMIN]
- Static files hosted on Google Storage
- POSTGRES DB hosted on Google SQL
- Enhanced Models

Shopify is a very powerful environment within which you can create & configure your Online Store.

The tooling is geared to the Store Owner focusing on setting up their business while Shopify takes care of the technical stuff.

External integrations make linking to external Product Providers very easy.

Which is a complicated way of saying you can source products, add your value & sell the result via your store.

## Sourdough SweetHeart: Product Sources
- Print On Demand - example
  - Printify: large range of products available to customise with your own graphics
  - e.g. https://sourdoughsweetheart.com/products/love-thy-baker-cork-back-coaster
  - <img src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/frontend-bucket-0/sdsh/cork-back-coaster-front-637e1ba8b1882.webp" width=500 alt="Love Thy Baker Coasters" />

- Amazon Associates
  - Source & Sell existing Amazon Products via your own Store
  - e.g. https://sourdoughsweetheart.com/products/pizza-stones-non-stick-cast-iron-pizza-bread-scones-durable-baking-stone-plate-for-tarts-muffins-bbq-quiches-cakes

  - <img src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/frontend-bucket-0/sdsh/51c0AqBiHlL.jpg" width=500 alt="Pizza Stone" />

- Kindle Direct Publishing
  - create your own Books & Sell via your Site in addition to Kindle
  - e.g. https://sourdoughsweetheart.com/products/sourdonista-red-map-your-baking-journey
  - This involves very specific formatting of your text.
  - My suggestion is that you focus on the formatting first to confirm you can reliably release your Book.
  - Once that's proven you are then free to focus on your creation.

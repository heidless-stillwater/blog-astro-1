# community rideout

Proof Of Concept.

Bare bones app to test out live map & routing functionality.

<img src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/frontend-bucket-0/sdsh/2023-03-24-151855-react-app-screenclip.png?authuser=0" width=500 alt="rideout app screenshot" />

Visit the app: https://main--delicate-daifuku-8678a4.netlify.app/

Intention is to provide logistical support to the teams out in the field.

I'll be building this out into a fully featured Dashboard based on the suggestions & feedback from the teams themselves.

This is also a test of the Deploy process with Git Triggers to automate deploy on Commit. Big Fan!

Astro 2.0 has been released with some cool features, breaking changes, DX improvements, better error overlay and so on. AstroPaper takes advantage of those cool features, especially Content Collections API.

<!-- ![Introducing AstroPaper 2.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53733092/215683840-dc2502f5-8c5a-44f0-a26c-4e7180455056.png) -->

## Table of contents

## Features & Changes

### Type-safe Frontmatters and Redefined Blog Schema

Frontmatter of AstroPaper 2.0 markdown contents are now type-safe thanks to Astroâ€™s Content Collections. Blog schema is defined inside the `src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

### New Home for Blog contents

All the blog posts were moved from `src/contents` to `src/content/blog` directory.

### New Fetch API

Contents are now fetched with `getCollection` function. No relative path to the content needs to be specified anymore.

```ts
// old content fetching method
- const postImportResult = import.meta.glob<MarkdownInstance<Frontmatter>>(
  "../contents/**/**/*.md",);

// new content fetching method
+ const postImportResult = await getCollection("blog");
```

### Modified Search Logic for better Search Result

In the older version of AstroPaper, when someone search some article, the search criteria keys that will be searched are `title`, `description` and `headings` (heading means all the headings h1 ~ h6 of the blog post). In AstroPaper v2, only `title` and `description` will be searched as the user types.

### Renamed Frontmatter Properties

The following frontmatter properties are renamed.

| Old Names | New Names   |
| --------- | ----------- |
| datetime  | pubDatetime |
| slug      | postSlug    |

### Default Tag for blog post

If a blog post doesn't have any tag (in other words, frontmatter property `tags` is not specified), the default tag `others` will be used for that blog post. But you can set the default tag in the `/src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

```ts
// src/contents/_schemas.ts
export const blogSchema = z.object({
  // ---
  // replace "others" with whatever you want
  tags: z.array(z.string()).default(["others"]),
  ogImage: z.string().optional(),
  description: z.string(),
});
```

### New Predefined Dark Color Scheme

AstroPaper v2 has a new dark color scheme (high contrast & low contrast) which is based on Astro's dark logo. Check out [this link](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/predefined-color-schemes#astro-dark) for more info.

### Automatic Class Sorting

AstroPaper 2.0 includes automatic class sorting with [TailwindCSS Prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)

### Updated Docs & README

All the [#docs](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/tags/docs/) blog posts and [README](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper#readme) are updated for this AstroPaper v2.

## Bug Fixes

- fix broken tags in the Blog Post page
- in a tag page, the last part of the breadcrumb is now updated to lower-case for consistency
- exclude draft posts in a tag page
- fix 'onChange value not updating issue' after a page reload

# community rideout

Proof Of Concept.

Bare bones app to test out live map & routing functionality.

Visit the app: https://main--delicate-daifuku-8678a4.netlify.app/

Intention is to provide logistical support to the teams out in the field.

I'll be building this out into a fully featured Dashboard based on the suggestions & feedback from the teams themselves.

This is also a test of the Deploy process with Git Triggers to automate deploy on Commit. Big Fan!
